              <p>Juicy on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside,
                 chicken drumsticks simply conquer from the first bite. 
                 You've probably tasted something similar at the KFC chain, 
                 but there they cook the drumsticks deep-fried. 
                 We wanted to recreate this recipe in the home kitchen and 
                 baked it in the oven. This method of cooking is also much 
                 simpler, because you don't need to cover yourself with a pot 
                 lid as a shield from splashes of hot oil. Believe me, in 
                 this case, the crispness will remain even if the drumsticks 
                 lie on the plate for an hour or two. And if you want to 
                 completely preserve the title of a "healthy" dish, serve it 
                 with homemade ketchup, tkemali sauce or mix thick unsweetened 
                 yogurt with lemon juice and squeezed garlic cloves. 
                 This will add piquancy, which is present in the original fast food dish.
                We also advise you to immediately buy more chicken to make 
                another interesting dish - chicken drumsticks in a spicy Asian-style sauce.
                TM "Nasha Ryaba" chicken drumsticks are well cleaned of feathers, so 
                just take them out and start cooking. 
                There is no need to wash either, because they are clean and stored 
                in vacuum packaging, and we do not need excess liquid. Do not remove 
                the skin from the drumsticks. It will give the dish even more juiciness.
                 Then you won't even feel it, because it will be well baked and it will 
                 be nice to crunch together with the breading. Our drumsticks turned out 
                 to be very tender in taste, so that they can be given to children. 
                 If you still want to make them spicy, add dry ground chili or black 
                 pepper. It is advisable to grind it yourself and do it before you add 
                 it to the drumsticks. Then it will provide not only burning, but also 
                 a characteristic rich aroma.
